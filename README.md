# MUSIFY - Music-Composition-using-AI
The Project has been developed to create new piece of music using Piano Notes
## About Project
1. Platform : Visual Studio Code / Jupyter Notebook
2. Language : Python 3.8
3. Libraries Used : Tensorflow, Music21, Keras, NumPy, Sklearn, tqdm
4. Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/classical-music-midi
##  Implementation
### What is Automatic Music Generation?
he Automatic Music Generation is a process of composing a short piece of music with minimum human intervention.
### What are the Constituent Elements of Music?
Music is essentially composed of Notes and Chords. Let me explain these terms from the perspective of the piano instrument:

1. Note: The sound produced by a single key is called a note
2. Chords: The sound produced by 2 or more keys simultaneously is called a chord. Generally, most chords contain at least 3 key sounds
3. Octave: A repeated pattern is called an octave. Each octave contains 7 white and 5 black keys
### Implementation
1. Import Libraries
2. Reading Musical Files
3. Preparing Data
4. Buid LSTM model
5. Tune the Hyper parameter by trail and error method
6. Save the best model
7. Compose the music

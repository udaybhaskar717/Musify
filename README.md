## What are the Constituent Elements of Music?
Music is essentially composed of Notes and Chords. Let me explain these terms from the perspective of the piano instrument:

Note: The sound produced by a single key is called a note
Chords: The sound produced by 2 or more keys simultaneously is called a chord. Generally, most chords contain at least 3 key sounds
Octave: A repeated pattern is called an octave. Each octave contains 7 white and 5 black keys

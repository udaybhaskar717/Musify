## Automatic Music Generator:
Music is a collection of tones of different frequencies. So, the Automatic Music Generation is a process of composing a short piece of music with minimum human intervention
## What are the Constituent Elements of Music?
Music is essentially composed of Notes and Chords. Let me explain these terms from the perspective of the piano instrument:

Note: The sound produced by a single key is called a note
Chords: The sound produced by 2 or more keys simultaneously is called a chord. Generally, most chords contain at least 3 key sounds
Octave: A repeated pattern is called an octave. Each octave contains 7 white and 5 black keys
##  Using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Model for Automatic Music Generation Implementation:
Music 21 is a Python library developed by MIT for understanding music data. MIDI is a standard format for storing music files. MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. MIDI files contain the instructions rather than the actual audio. Hence, it occupies very little memory. Thatâ€™s why it is usually preferred while transferring files.
